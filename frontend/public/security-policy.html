  <h2>Disclosure Policy</h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. Include the version number of the vulnerable component if applicable.</li>
    <li>We ask that you give us a reasonable time to investigate and address any findings before public disclosure.</li>
    <li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services.</li>
    <li>Only interact with accounts you own or for which you have explicit permission from the account holder.</li>
